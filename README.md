This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

In order to be able to run this project you will need Mongo, Node and Yarn installed in your system. 
If all that is done, then the following instructions should work =>

```bash
Clone the repo, and cd into it.
1. - yarn build:next
2. - yarn start:dev
(any other time, just follow the second rule)
```

Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) with your browser to see the result.

This is a NextJS project simply to serve SSR without much set up at all. 

### I'd like to add if this were for production purposes:

- [ ] TS to the server.
- [ ] Authentication to server.
- [x] Code documentation
- [ ] Add Cypress on client side
- [ ] Add unit test on server side
